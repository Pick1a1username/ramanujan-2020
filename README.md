This app is the example of microservices and is originally developed for the book [*The Tao of Microservices*](http://bit.ly/rmtaomicro). 

I cloned the original source code from the following commit:

https://github.com/senecajs/ramanujan/commit/69e61a90ada50d1f20999dc7e3af2e5c4737e02c


## Todo

I'd like to customize this app to my personal preferences as follow:

* separate package.json ->Done
* make it work with node 14
* replace packages deprecated or not maintained anymore
* make it work on k8s
* make it work with skaffold
* rewrite it in typescript
* add some more descriptions to README.md if possible

I hope that I can learn about microservices by doing things I mentioned above.
